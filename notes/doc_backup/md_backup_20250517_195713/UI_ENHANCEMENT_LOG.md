# Gnosis Wraith UI Enhancement Log

## Frontend Enhancements - May 16, 2025

This document tracks the UI improvements and bug fixes made to the Gnosis Wraith frontend interface.

### Summary of Recent Changes

We've made several significant enhancements to the frontend interface of Gnosis Wraith, focusing on improving file handling, search functionality, and overall user experience.

### File Upload Improvements

#### 1. File Selection and Clear Button
- Added a clear button (X) that appears when a file is selected
- Improved the file selection workflow to show selected filename and file size
- Fixed UI transitions between file mode and URL mode
- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for images and PDFs

#### 2. Mode-Specific Options
- Created a `toggleFileUploadMode()` function that switches the interface between file and URL modes
- When a file is selected:
  - Hides URL-specific options (JavaScript, Content Processing, Screenshot)
  - Shows only file-relevant options (OCR Extraction, Custom Report Title)
  - Changes the submit button text from "Unleash the Wraith" to "Process File"
  - Changes the button icon from ghost to file import

#### 3. File Upload Endpoint
- Fixed the file upload functionality to use the correct endpoint (`/api/upload`)
- Corrected the form parameter name from 'file' to 'image' to match backend expectations
- Improved error handling during file upload

### URL Search Enhancements

#### 1. Hash Parameter Handling
- Fixed an issue with the URL hash parameter handling (`/#?q=term&w=1`)
- Added smart URL processing to properly handle different types of search inputs:
  - Maps predefined search terms (like "tech news") to their corresponding URLs
  - Automatically adds "https://" prefix for domain-like inputs
  - Preserves full URLs that already include a protocol

#### 2. Predefined Search Terms
- Maintained consistency between URL hash handling and manual input handling
- Added the same dictionary of search terms in both the inline script and main script

### Visual Improvements

- Added highlight effects for drag-and-drop operations
- Implemented subtle animations for better visual feedback
- Enhanced the mobile responsiveness of the interface

### Bug Fixes

1. **Clear File Selection**
   - Replaced page reload with smooth UI state transition
   - Properly resets the file input field and related UI elements

2. **URL Search Redirects**
   - Fixed the issue where search terms passed via URL weren't properly converted to crawlable URLs
   - Added proper URL protocol prefixing for inputs that appear to be domains

3. **Browser Compatibility**

   - Removed references to newer selectors (like `:has`) for better compatibility
