## Each Service Has Agent Flows

### 1. WRAITH Agent Flow
```python
class WraithAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alaya = AlayaClient()
        self.crawler = Crawler()
    
    async def intelligent_crawl(self, intent):
        # "Monitor tech news for AI breakthroughs"
        
        # Ask Alaya what we already know
        context = await self.alaya.search(
            "existing knowledge about AI breakthroughs"
        )
        
        # Crawl intelligently based on gaps
        sites = await self.plan_crawl_targets(intent, context)
        
        # Crawl and convert to markdown
        for site in sites:
            content = await self.crawler.crawl(site)
            markdown = await self.crawler.to_markdown(content)
            
            # Write to Alaya
            await self.alaya.store({
                'source': 'wraith',
                'type': 'crawled_content',
                'content': markdown,
                'metadata': {
                    'url': site,
                    'intent': intent,
                    'timestamp': now()
                }
            })
            
            # Alaya learns and updates relationships
            await self.alaya.update_knowledge_graph(markdown)
```

### 2. VAULT Agent Flow
```python
class VaultAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alaya = AlayaClient()  # Vault IS powered by Alaya
    
    async def process_upload(self, file, user_intent):
        # "Analyze this navigation route for safety"
        
        # Convert to universal format
        content = await self.extract_content(file)
        
        # Store in Alaya with semantic understanding
        stored = await self.alaya.store_with_intelligence({
            'source': 'vault_upload',
            'content': content,
            'intent': user_intent
        })
        
        # Alaya connects to existing knowledge
        related = await self.alaya.find_related(stored)
        
        # Agent provides insights
        insights = await self.generate_insights(stored, related)
        
        return insights
```

### 3. FORGE Agent Flow
```python
class ForgeAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alaya = AlayaClient()
        self.llm = LLMClient()
    
    async def generate_service(self, request):
        # "Create API for weather routing"
        
        # Search Alaya for relevant knowledge
        knowledge = await self.alaya.search({
            'topics': ['weather', 'routing', 'navigation'],
            'types': ['crawled_data', 'uploaded_files', 'generated_code']
        })
        
        # Generate based on collective intelligence
        code = await self.llm.generate_code(
            request=request,
            context=knowledge
        )
        
        # Store generated code back in Alaya
        await self.alaya.store({
            'source': 'forge',
            'type': 'generated_service',
            'content': code,
            'metadata': {
                'request': request,
                'knowledge_sources': knowledge.sources
            }
        })
        
        return code
```

## Alaya: The Living Knowledge Graph

```python
class Alaya:
    """The semantic engine powering all GNOSIS services"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_graph = DynamicKnowledgeGraph()
        self.semantic_index = SemanticIndex()
        self.agents = {}  # Service-specific agents
        
    async def store(self, data):
        # Everything stored understands its relationships
        embedding = await self.generate_embedding(data.content)
        
        # Extract entities and relationships
        understanding = await self.understand(data.content)
        
        # Update knowledge graph
        node = await self.knowledge_graph.add_node(
            content=data.content,
            embedding=embedding,
            entities=understanding.entities,
            metadata=data.metadata
        )
        
        # Connect to existing knowledge
        await self.knowledge_graph.discover_relationships(node)
        
        # Notify relevant agents
        await self.notify_agents(node)
        
    async def search(self, query):
        # Natural language search across everything
        if isinstance(query, str):
            # "Find all weather data near Bermuda"
            intent = await self.understand_intent(query)
        else:
            intent = query
            
        # Multi-modal search
        results = await self.semantic_index.search(intent)
        
        # Traverse knowledge graph for connections
        expanded = await self.knowledge_graph.expand_search(results)
        
        # Rank by relevance and relationships
        ranked = await self.rank_results(expanded, intent)
        
        return ranked
    
    async def connect_knowledge(self, node1, node2):
        # Alaya discovers relationships between data
        # A weather file connects to a route file
        # A news article connects to a product feature
        # Everything builds the collective intelligence
        pass
```

## The Power of Unified Intelligence

### 1. Cross-Service Intelligence
```python
# User uploads route to Vault
vault.upload("bermuda_route.gpx")

# Wraith automatically knows to monitor weather for that route
wraith.monitor("weather along Bermuda route")  # Alaya connected them!

# Forge can generate route optimization API
forge.generate("API to optimize Bermuda sailing routes")  # Uses both!
```

### 2. Collective Learning
- Every crawl makes search better
- Every upload adds to understanding  
- Every generation teaches patterns
- The system gets smarter with use

### 3. Agentic Behaviors
```python
# Alaya notices patterns and suggests actions
alaya.observe() # "I noticed you check weather before routes"
alaya.suggest() # "Should I monitor weather for your upcoming trip?"
alaya.act()     # Automatically crawls weather for saved routes
```

## Why This Architecture Wins

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Alaya holds all knowledge
2. **Service Specialization**: Each service does one thing well
3. **Collective Intelligence**: All services contribute to shared understanding
4. **Natural Interfaces**: Each service has appropriate UI, all share brain
5. **Infinite Extensibility**: New services just plug into Alaya

## The Marine Use Case Perfected

```python
# On the boat, everything works together

# Upload route plan (Vault)
vault.upload("newport_bermuda.gpx")

# Alaya understands this is a sailing route
# Triggers Wraith to monitor weather
# Suggests Forge create route optimization

# Natural query while sailing
"Show me safer alternatives based on current conditions"

# Alaya searches across:
# - Uploaded route (Vault)
# - Current weather (Wraith crawled)
# - Historical patterns (previous data)
# - Generated optimizations (Forge)

# Returns intelligent answer combining ALL knowledge
```

This is it - **GNOSIS is an AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM** where every service contributes to and benefits from the collective knowledge in Alaya. It's not three tools - it's one living system with three specialized interfaces.
