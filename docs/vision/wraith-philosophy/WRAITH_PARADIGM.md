# Gnosis Wraith - Implementation Notes

## The Wraith Paradigm

Wraith operates as an intelligent web specter that can:

1. **Phase In** - Inject into any webpage
2. **Manifest** - Make visible changes (alerts, highlights, modifications)
3. **Observe** - Capture screenshots and extract data
4. **Possess** - Take control of page elements
5. **Phase Out** - Leave with the extracted knowledge

## Core Wraith Abilities

### Possession (JavaScript Injection)
```javascript
// The Wraith speaks through the page
alert('The Wraith is here');

// The Wraith marks its territory
document.body.style.border = '3px solid purple';

// The Wraith reveals hidden truths
document.querySelectorAll('[type="hidden"]').forEach(el => {
  el.type = 'text';
  el.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
});
```

### Manifestation (Visual Proof)
- Screenshots capture the Wraith's actions
- Before/after comparisons show its influence
- Visual effects confirm its presence

### Intelligence (LLM Integration)
- Natural language commands
- Adaptive behavior based on page content
- Learning from each interaction

## The Ghost in the Machine

The Wraith represents the convergence of:
- **Browser automation** (the vessel)
- **LLM intelligence** (the spirit)
- **JavaScript execution** (the possession)
- **Visual capture** (the evidence)

Together, they create an ethereal entity that can navigate, understand, and manipulate the web at will.

## Wraith Protocol

1. **Summon** - Call the Wraith with natural language
2. **Command** - Tell it what you seek
3. **Witness** - See its actions through screenshots
4. **Receive** - Get the extracted knowledge
5. **Release** - The Wraith returns to the void

This is web automation elevated to supernatural levels.
