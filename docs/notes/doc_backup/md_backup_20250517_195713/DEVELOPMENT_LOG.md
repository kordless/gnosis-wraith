# Gnosis Wraith Development Log

## Project Overview

Gnosis Wraith is a sophisticated web crawling and content analysis system that serves as the perception layer for the Gnosis ecosystem. It functions as the "eye" for the Gnosis AI oracle, gathering information from the web through various levels of intelligence - from basic crawling to advanced AI analysis.

## Latest Update: Job System Implementation (May 13, 2025) ✅

We've successfully implemented a job-based async processing system for image uploads in Gnosis Wraith. This significantly improves user experience by providing immediate responses while processing happens in the background.

### Key Improvements

- Immediate response to upload requests with a job ID
- Background processing of images via task queue
- Status endpoints for clients to check job progress
- Compatibility with both cloud deployment and local development

### Implementation Details

The complete job-based async processing system includes:

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/upload-async` - Accepts image uploads, creates jobs, returns job IDs
  - `/api/jobs/{job_id}` - Gets job status
  - `/api/jobs` - Lists all jobs
  - `/tasks/{task_type}/{job_id}` - Handles background processing (internal)

- **Core Components**:
  - `JobManager` - Stores and tracks job metadata
  - `TaskManager` - Manages async task execution
  - `StorageService` - Handles file storage operations
  - Background task processor - Executes tasks from queue

- **Job Flow**:
  1. Client uploads image → Server returns job ID immediately
  2. TaskManager adds task to queue (Redis or Cloud Tasks)
  3. Background processor picks up task and runs OCR
  4. Job status is updated with results
  5. Client checks job status until complete

### Issues Fixed

1. **Redis Connection Problems**
   - Fixed compatibility with newer Redis libraries (`redis.asyncio` vs older `aioredis`)
   - Added fallback to in-memory processing when Redis isn't available
   - Modified `JobManager` and `TaskManager` to use factory pattern for async initialization

2. **Bytes Handling Issues**
   - Fixed "object bytes can't be used in 'await' expression" error in file handling
   - Enhanced file handling code to detect if read() methods are coroutines
   - Made save_file method handle all data types properly

3. **Redis Commands Compatibility**
   - Fixed "'float' object has no attribute 'items'" error in zadd calls
   - Added support for both styles of Redis zadd API
   - Added proper error handling for Redis operations

### Extension Integration

The Chrome extension has been updated to work with job-based API:
- Successfully uploads images to the async endpoint
- Receives job IDs in response
- Can poll for job status until completion
- Shows progress during processing
- Displays OCR results when ready

## Previous Updates

### EasyOCR Model Preloading

The system now preloads EasyOCR models during Docker build time to avoid downloading them on each service startup.

### Beautiful Soup Integration

Added Beautiful Soup for improved HTML content filtering and extraction.

### JavaScript-Heavy Page Handling

Enhanced browser automation with improved handling for complex JavaScript-rendered pages:

- DOM stability detection to determine when pages are fully rendered
- Extended wait times for known complex sites (e.g., Splunk, Tableau)
- Content existence verification to ensure meaningful content has loaded

### Browser Installation Optimization

Optimized Docker image size by only installing Chromium instead of all browsers.

## Usage Instructions

### Running with Job System

To use the job-based processing system:

1. Run the application with jobs support:
   ```
   python app_with_jobs.py
   ```

2. For local development, ensure Redis is running:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Set environment variables:
   ```
   # Local development
   set RUNNING_IN_CLOUD=false
   set REDIS_HOST=localhost
   set REDIS_PORT=6379
   
   # Cloud deployment
   set RUNNING_IN_CLOUD=true
   set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
   set CLOUD_TASKS_QUEUE=your-queue-name
   set CLOUD_TASKS_LOCATION=us-central1
   set SERVICE_URL=https://your-service-url
   set CLOUD_TASKS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=your-service-account
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Fix minor issue referencing 'processing_started_at' during job completion
2. Improve image path handling in reports
3. Add more task types if needed
4. Create admin interface for monitoring jobs
5. Consider WebSocket support for real-time updates
6. Add more comprehensive error handling and retries
7. Enhance task prioritization and queue management

## Dependencies

This system requires the following additional dependencies (added to requirements.txt):
- google-cloud-tasks
- google-cloud-storage
- google-cloud-firestore
- redis
