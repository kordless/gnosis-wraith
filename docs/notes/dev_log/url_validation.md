# URL Validation Enhancement - Gnosis Wraith

**Date:** May 25, 2025  
**Author:** Claude  
**Component:** Gnosis HTML Interface  

## Issue Summary

The Gnosis Wraith interface currently sends all user inputs to the `/api/suggest` API endpoint, even when they're clearly valid URLs. This creates unnecessary API calls and slows down the user experience for direct URL inputs.

## Solution Overview

Implement a two-step approach for processing user inputs:

1. First check if input appears to be a valid URL using client-side validation
2. If valid, try crawling directly without suggestion API
3. Only use suggestion API as fallback when:
   - Input doesn't look like a URL (e.g., it's a search query)
   - Direct crawl fails

## Benefits

- Faster response time for valid URLs
- Reduced load on suggestion API
- Better user experience with direct crawling
- Maintains fallback to suggestion API when needed

## Implementation Plan

The change requires modifying the `handleSearch` function in gnosis.html to add URL validation logic and conditional processing flow. No server-side changes are needed.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the validation logic
2. Test with various input types (URLs, domains without protocol, search queries)
3. Verify error handling still works properly
4. Monitor API call reduction after deployment
