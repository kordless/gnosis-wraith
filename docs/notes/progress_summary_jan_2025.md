# Gnosis Wraith Progress Summary - January 2025

## What We've Accomplished Today

### 1. **Browser Extension Redesign** ‚úÖ
- Created clean, minimalist popup interface (`popup_clean.html/js`)
- Replaced ugly sliders with compact old-school toggle switch
- Simplified to just: Full Page toggle, Capture button, Server dropdown
- Removed upload option, integrated into server selection
- Updated manifest.json to version 1.4.1

### 2. **Extension Build Process** ‚úÖ
- Fixed Docker extension versioning issue
- Added ARG EXTENSION_VERSION to Dockerfile for automatic version detection
- Updated pages.py to serve versioned extension files
- Extension now downloads as `gnosis-wraith-extension-1.4.1.zip`

### 3. **Storage Architecture Overhaul** ‚úÖ
- Identified critical issue: Docker uses internal volume, reports disappear on restart
- Created comprehensive storage fix plans:
  - `local_storage_fix_plan.md` - Immediate fix for persistence
  - `unified_user_storage_plan.md` - User partitioning design
  - `unified_user_storage_plan_revised.md` - Hybrid NDB + Storage approach

### 4. **Hybrid NDB + Storage Implementation** ‚úÖ
Claude Code successfully implemented:
- Updated User model with storage_hash, usage tracking
- Enhanced StorageService to work with NDB users
- Modified API routes to use NDB for user management
- Created migration script for existing data
- Proper user isolation with hash-based directories

### 5. **Architecture Discussions** ‚úÖ
- Explored serverless architecture patterns
- Discussed time-based storage partitioning (Loggly-style)
- Investigated pure GCS storage option
- Discovered Alaya's hybrid search capabilities

## Current Issues

### 1. **NDB Context Manager Error** üêõ
```python
TypeError: ndb_context_manager() missing 1 required positional argument: 'func'
```
The `ndb_context_manager` is being used as a context manager (`with`) but it's actually a decorator. Should be:
```python
# Wrong
with ndb_context_manager():
    # code

# Right
@ndb_context_manager
def some_function():
    # code

# Or for inline use
async def list_reports():
    # Just use the models directly in dev
    # ndb_local handles context automatically
```

## What's Left To Do

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Fix NDB context manager usage** - Remove `with` statements, use as decorator
2. **Update docker-compose.yml** - Change volume mount to `./storage:/data`
3. **Test report persistence** - Verify multiple reports don't overwrite

### Next Phase Implementation
1. **Time-based storage partitioning**
   - Add `/YYYY/MM/DD/` to storage paths
   - Implement lifecycle management for old reports

2. **Alaya Integration Planning**
   - Design crawl ‚Üí index pipeline
   - Implement LLM keyterm extraction
   - Set up ChromaDB for vector storage
   - Create hybrid search endpoints

3. **Serverless Migration Path**
   - Start with crawl endpoint as Cloud Function
   - Move to event-driven architecture
   - Implement background indexing jobs

### Future Enhancements
1. **Collection-based search indices** with TTL
2. **Progressive enhancement** of search capabilities
3. **User quotas and usage tracking**
4. **Multi-tenant deployment** readiness

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Storage**: Hybrid approach - NDB for users, filesystem/GCS for content
2. **User Isolation**: SHA256(email)[:12] for consistent hashing
3. **Search**: Planning Alaya integration for hybrid semantic search
4. **Deployment**: Docker for now, serverless as end goal

## Key Insights from Discussion

- **From Loggly experience**: Time-based partitioning is crucial for scale
- **Serverless is the goal**: Event-driven, pay-per-use architecture
- **Hybrid search**: Combine bitmap speed with vector intelligence
- **Simple can work**: Pure GCS storage is viable if we accept slower indexing

## Current State

The system now has:
- Proper user management in NDB
- Isolated storage per user
- Usage tracking and statistics
- Clean browser extension
- Plans for scalable architecture

Ready to move forward with fixing the context manager issue and implementing time-based storage!
