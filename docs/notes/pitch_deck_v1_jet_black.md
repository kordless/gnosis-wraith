## GNOSIS
### The Intelligence Layer for the AI Internet

*Website Xeroxing with Intelligence*

**[Logo: Minimalist eye transforming into neural network on jet black background]**

---

# [SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM]

## The Web Wasn't Built for AI

- **10 billion websites** exist today
- **0.01%** have APIs
- **$64B** spent annually on data integration
- **87%** of AI projects fail due to data access

**Every business needs AI. The web has the data. There's no bridge.**

---

# [SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION]

## GNOSIS: See. Remember. Understand. Create.

**One Platform. Infinite Intelligence.**

```
WRAITH → Sees any website (with human help when needed)
VAULT  → Remembers everything in living memory  
ALAYA  → Understands relationships and meaning
FORGE  → Creates new services from understanding
```

**Turn any website into an API in minutes.**

# [SLIDE 5: DEMO - THE MAGIC]

## Live Demo: news.ycombinator.com → API

1. **WRAITH crawls** HackerNews (10 seconds)
2. **ALAYA understands** content structure 
3. **FORGE generates** custom API
4. **RESULT**: Live API with endpoints:
   - `/trending` - Top AI stories
   - `/search` - Natural language search
   - `/monitor` - Real-time alerts

**From website to API: 47 seconds**
