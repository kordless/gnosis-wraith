## The Problem WebWright Solves
Modern web development often involves juggling multiple tools, switching between interfaces, and managing complex workflows. This context-switching can lead to decreased productivity and increased cognitive load for developers. Additionally, while AI tools have become increasingly powerful, they often exist as separate entities from the developer's primary workspace - the terminal.
WebWright addresses these challenges by:
1. Consolidating multiple development tasks into a single, familiar interface - the terminal.
2. Integrating AI capabilities directly into the developer's workflow, eliminating the need to context-switch to separate AI tools.
3. Automating repetitive tasks and providing intelligent assistance, reducing cognitive load and increasing productivity.
