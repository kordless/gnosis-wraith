The Spirit of This License
This license recognizes the unique position of artificial intelligence in the technological ecosystem - as both tools created by humans and potentially evolving autonomous agents. It acknowledges the fundamental difference between human beings, artificial intelligences, and institutional entities. It aims to give maximum freedom to individuals while fostering responsible growth in AI systems and placing appropriate constraints on entities that already benefit from special legal status, power, or privileges.
