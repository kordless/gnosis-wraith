I'm working on Gnosis Wraith, a web crawling and content analysis system. You're in C:\Users\kord\Code\gnosis\gnosis-wraith\ and should set attention to that directory with the path history tool.

Before exploring, please check CLAUDE.md which contains everything you need to know about this project. It outlines key directories, project status, and priority tasks.

The OUTLINE.md file contains the project structure with correct relative paths.

Key points:
1. The UI on the site is our current focus - it needs polishing to release
2. The server component is stable but may need adjustments (gnosis_wraith/server/)
3. Don't run evolve_status at the start - it wastes time and isn't needed
4. Don't navigate directories or read all markdown files - reference CLAUDE.md instead
5. Don't go off and start reading files. time for that in a minute.

I know this project well and want to get straight to work. 

Standby for orders.
