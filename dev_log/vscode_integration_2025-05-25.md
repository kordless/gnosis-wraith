# VSCode Integration Update - May 25, 2025
THIS PROJECT IS A SIDE PROJECT AND NOT INTEGRAL TO WRAITH
IT IS TESTING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET A PLUGIN FOR VSCODE FOR EVOLVE
CURRENTLY ON BACK BURNER
## Summary
Successfully fixed integration between `search_in_file_fuzzy` tool and VSCode extension navigation. The server now properly communicates search results to VSCode, and the extension handles both same-file and cross-file navigation correctly.

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed 500 error responses in the `/vscode-poll` endpoint
- Resolved issue where navigation targets weren't being correctly sent to VSCode 
- Added proper handling of empty poll requests
- Enhanced logging for easier debugging
- Updated the VSCode extension to properly handle file opening

## Technical Details
1. Added error handling for missing Content-Length headers
2. Modified the server to always include target_file with target_line
3. Fixed target clearing logic to only clear after confirmed navigation
4. Enhanced the VSCode extension to support opening files when no active editor exists
5. Improved logging output to track entire communication flow

## Next Steps
- Consider improving extension resilience with backoff retry logic
- Add option to visualize search matches in the editor
- Explore multi-match navigation capabilities

Broken. Does not work. Extension seems to lock up and not poll, which isn't ideal anyway. we need to be able to talk to an API or something. WIll work on this later. As a side note, this work caused claude to not be able to work on the project it was confused.
