The debut is one of the first among recent IPOs that was not a so-called down-round. Many of the latest public listings, including [Hinge](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/hinge-health-pops-17-but-joins-growing-ranks-of-down-round-ipos/), [ServiceTitan](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/servicetitan-prices-at-71-above-expected-range-.html), and \u00a0[Reddit](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/reddit-prices-ipo-at-34-per-share-the-top-of-the-range/), priced below their private market highs, though have faired well as public companies.\n\nFor founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the successful public offering validates his decision to start a company that he believed the market desperately needed. In 2011, he dropped out of Harvard Medical School after realizing that chronic illness patients required more continuous support than the existing healthcare system delivered. \u00a0\n\nBefore the offering, he owned 4.1% of the company, according to Omada\u2019s [offering document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1611115/000119312525129904/d785770ds1a.htm#toc785770_17). \u00a0Other significant shareholders included Revelation Partners (10.9%), US Venture Partners (9.9%), Andreessen Horowitz (9.6%), and FMR (9.3%).\n\nDuffy told TechCrunch that over his 14-year journey as a founder, he had many harrowing moments.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think our series A was going to come together because we were working on this commercial deal that didn\u2019t materialize, and that spooked one investor,\u201d he said.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass\n\n#### Build smarter.
