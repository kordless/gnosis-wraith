The shift represents a response to law enforcement's growing success in targeting traditional \"bulletproof\" hosting services, which previously allowed criminals to maintain anonymous web infrastructure. \n\nResidential proxies route traffic through decentralized networks running on consumer devices like old Android phones and low-end laptops, providing real IP addresses assigned to homes and offices. This approach makes malicious activity extremely difficult to detect because it appears to originate from trusted consumer locations rather than suspicious server farms. The technology creates particular challenges when attackers appear to come from the same residential IP ranges as employees of target organizations.\n\n177949807\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tBritain is moving toward major nuclear power commitments after years of delays, as government officials acknowledge they can [no longer postpone critical energy infrastructure decisions](https://www.politico.eu/article/nuclear-power-will-spending-reviews-big-winner-philip-hunt/). The U.K. Treasury has exhausted options for delaying nuclear power choices, Politico reported this week, citing sources within Whitehall and the nuclear industry. \n\nThe urgency stems from Britain's aging nuclear infrastructure, where five power plants currently supply 15% of the country's total energy needs but face shutdown by 2030. This timeline has created significant pressure on policymakers to secure replacement capacity or risk substantial gaps in the nation's electricity supply.\n\n177948324\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tStartup [Nord Quantique](https://nordquantique.ca/en) has demonstrated that a single piece of hardware [can host an error-detecting logical qubit](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/startup-puts-a-logical-qubit-in-a-single-piece-of-hardware/) by using two quantum frequencies within one resonator. The breakthrough has the potential to slash the hardware demands for quantum error correction and deliver more compact and efficient quantum computing architectures. Ars Technica reports: _ The company did two experiments with this new hardware. First, it ran multiple rounds of error detection on data stored in the logical qubit, essentially testing its ability to act like a quantum memory and retain the information stored there. Without correcting errors, the system rapidly decayed, with an error probability in each round of measurement of about 12 percent. By the time the system reached the 25th measurement, almost every instance had already encountered an error. The second time through, the company repeated the process, discarding any instances in which an error occurred. In almost every instance, that meant the results were discarded long before they got through two dozen rounds of measurement. But at these later stages, none of the remaining instances were in an erroneous state. That indicates that a successful correction of the errors -- something the team didn't try -- would be able to fix all the detected problems.\n \nSeveral other companies have already performed experiments in which errors were detected -- and corrected. In a few instances, companies have even performed operations with logical qubits, although these were not sophisticated calculations. Nord Quantique, in contrast, is only showing the operation of a single logical qubit, so it's not even possible to test a two-qubit gate operation using the hardware it has described so far. So simply being able to identify the occurrence of errors is not on the cutting edge. Why is this notable?\n \nAll the other companies require multiple hardware qubits to host a single logical qubit. Since building many hardware qubits has been an ongoing challenge, most researchers have plans to minimize the number of hardware qubits needed to support a logical qubit -- some combination of high-quality hardware, a clever error correction scheme, and/or a hardware-specific feature that catches the most common errors. You can view Nord Quantique's approach as being at the extreme end of the spectrum of solutions, where the number of hardware qubits required is simply one. From Nord Quantique's perspective, that's significant because it means that its hardware will ultimately occupy less space and have lower power and cooling requirements than some of its competitors. (Other hardware, like neutral atoms, requires lots of lasers and a high vacuum, so the needs are difficult to compare.) But it also means that, should it become technically difficult to get large numbers of qubits to operate as a coherent whole, Nord Quantique's approach may ultimately help us overcome some of these limits.\n _\n\n177948510\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tApple has [urged Australia not to follow the European Union](https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-warns-australia-against-joining-eu-in-mandating-iphone-app-sideloading/) in mandating iPhone app sideloading, warning that such policies pose serious privacy and security risks. \"This communication comes as the Australian federal government considers new rules that could force Apple to open up its iOS ecosystem, much like what happened in Europe with recent legislation,\" notes Neowin. Apple claims that allowing alternative app stores has led to increased exposure to malware, scams, and harmful content. From the report: _ Apple, in its response to [this Australian paper](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-12/c2024-547447-pp.pdf) (PDF), stated that Australia should not use the EU's Digital Markets Act \"as a blueprint\". The company's core argument is that the changes mandated by the EU's DMA, which came into full effect in March 2024, introduce serious security and privacy risks for users. Apple claims that allowing sideloading and alternative app stores effectively opens the door for malware, fraud, scams, and other harmful content. The tech company also highlighted specific concerns from its European experience, alleging that its compliance there has led to users being able to install pornography apps and apps that facilitate copyright infringement, things its curated App Store aims to prevent. Apple maintains that its current review process is vital for user protection, and that its often criticized 30% commission applies mainly to the highest earning apps, with most developers paying a lower 15% rate or nothing._\n\n177947982\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tAn anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: _In 2019, we told you about a new [interactive digital \"murder map](https://www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk/vrcresearch/london-medieval-murder-map)\" of London compiled by University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner. Drawing on data catalogued in the city coroners' rolls, the map showed the approximate location of 142 homicide cases in late medieval London. The Medieval Murder Maps project has since expanded to include maps of York and Oxford homicides, as well as podcast episodes focusing on individual cases. It's easy to lose oneself down the rabbit hole of medieval murder for hours, filtering the killings by year, choice of weapon, and location. Think of it as a kind of 14th-century version of Clue: It was the noblewoman's hired assassins armed with daggers in the streets of Cheapside near St. Paul's Cathedral. And that's just [the juiciest of the various cases](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/cold-case-files-the-medieval-murder-of-a-troublesome-priest/) described in a new paper [published in the journal Criminal Law Forum](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10609-025-09512-7?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=commission_junction&utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_GL_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&utm_content=textlink&utm_term=PID100017430&CJEVENT=9194da65431b11f083eb00a50a1cb827).\n \nThe noblewoman was Ela Fitzpayne, wife of a knight named Sir Robert Fitzpayne, lord of Stogursey. The victim was a priest and her erstwhile lover, John Forde, who was stabbed to death in the streets of Cheapside on May 3, 1337. \"We are looking at a murder commissioned by a leading figure of the English aristocracy,\" [said University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085953?), who heads the Medieval Murder Maps project. \"It is planned and cold-blooded, with a family member and close associates carrying it out, all of which suggests a revenge motive.\" Members of the mapping project geocoded all the cases after determining approximate locations for the crime scenes. Written in Latin, the coroners' rolls are records of sudden or suspicious deaths as investigated by a jury of local men, called together by the coroner to establish facts and reach a verdict. Those records contain such relevant information as where the body was found and by whom; the nature of the wounds; the jury's verdict on cause of death; the weapon used and how much it was worth; the time, location, and witness accounts; whether the perpetrator was arrested, escaped, or sought sanctuary; and any legal measures taken._ The full historical context, analytical depth, and social commentary can be read in the [the paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10609-025-09512-7).\n \nInterestingly, Eisner \"extended their spatial analysis to include homicides committed in York and London in the 14th century with similar conclusions,\" writes Ars' Jennifer Ouellette. Most murders often occurred in public places, usually on weekends, with knives and swords as primary weapons. Oxford had a significantly elevated violence rate compared to London and York, \"suggestive of high levels of social disorganization and impunity.\"\n \nLondon, meanwhile, showed distinct clusters of homicides, \"which reflect differences in economic and social functions,\" the authors wrote. \"In all three cities, some homicides were committed in spaces of high visibility and symbolic significance.\"\n\n177949423\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tPhysicists at Loughborough University have created what they believe is [the world's smallest violin](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp92pr5pr48o), measuring just 35 microns long and 13 microns wide -- smaller than the width of a human hair, which typically ranges from 17 to 180 microns in diameter. The microscopic instrument, created using the university's new nanolithography system, serves as a demonstration of precision manufacturing capabilities that researchers will apply to studies of computing efficiency and energy harvesting methods. \n\nThe team used a NanoFrazor machine employing thermal scanning probe lithography, where a heated needle-like tip etches highly precise patterns at the nanoscale onto a chip coated with gel-like resist material. While the individual violin takes roughly three hours to produce, the research team spent several months refining their techniques to achieve the final result, which exists as a microscopic image rather than a playable instrument.\n\n177948194\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tLongtime Slashdot reader [sinij](/~sinij) shares a report from Car and Driver: _ [Volvo] is [debuting](https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/349551/volvo-cars-introduces-world-first-multi-adaptive-safety-belt-in-the-upcoming-volvo-ex60) a new version of the three-point seatbelt that it believes is a major improvement over the original. The new design will be a smart belt that adapts to each occupant's body and adjusts the belt load accordingly. It uses data from interior and exterior sensors to customize protection based on the road conditions and the specific occupants. The technology will debut on the upcoming EX60 crossover.\n \nAccording to Volvo, the onboard sensors can accurately detect a passenger's height, weight, body shape, and seating position. Based on real-time data, the belts optimize protection -- increasing belt load for larger passengers or lowering it for smaller passengers. While the technology for customizing protection isn't new -- Volvo's current belts already use three load-limiting profiles- the new belts increase that number to 11. The belts should also get safer over time, too, as they are [equipped to receive over-the-air updates](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64970457/volvo-smart-seatbelt-revealed/). _ _sinij adds: \"Downloading patches for your seat belts from China.

The [FAIR Package Manager project](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-fair-package-manager-project-for-open-source-content-management-system-stability) is a response to the legal brawl that [erupted last year](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/10/1757231/automattic-slashes-wordpressorg-support-in-battle-with-wp-engine), pitting WordPress co-creator Matthew Mullenweg, his for-profit hosting firm Automattic, and the WordPress Foundation that he controls, against WP Engine, a rival commercial WordPress hosting firm. [...]\n \nThe Linux Foundation says the FAIR Package Manager, a mechanism for distributing open-source WordPress plugins, \"eliminates reliance on any single source for core updates, plugins, themes, and more, unites a fragmented ecosystem by bringing together plugins from any source, and builds security into the supply chain.\" In other words, it can't be weaponized against the WordPress community because it won't be controlled by any one entity. \"The FAIR Package Manager project paves the way for the stability and growth of open source content management, giving contributors and businesses additional options governed by a neutral community,\" said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation, in a canned press statement. \"We look forward to the growth in community and contributions this important project attracts.\"\n \nThe [FAIR Package Manager repo](https://github.com/fairpm) explains the software's purpose more succinctly. The software \"is a decentralized alternative to the central WordPress.org plugin and theme ecosystem, designed to return control to WordPress hosts and developers. It operates as a drop-in WordPress plugin, seamlessly replacing existing centralized services with a federated, open-source infrastructure.\" In addition to providing some measure of stability, the Linux Foundation sees the FAIR Package Manager as advancing WordPress' alignment with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation by reducing automatic browser data transmission and telemetry sent to commercial entities, while also supporting modern security practices and strengthening the open source software supply chain._\n\n177948106\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tApple's [Worldwide Developers Conference 25](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/) (WWDC) kicks off next week, June 9th, showcasing the company's latest software and new technologies. That includes the next version of iOS, which is rumored to have the most significant design overhaul since the introduction of iOS 7. Here's an overview of what to expect: _\n**Major Software Redesigns** \nApple plans to shift its operating system naming to [reflect the release year](https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/05/28/1953246/apple-will-announce-ios-26-at-wwdc-not-ios-19), moving from sequential numbers to year-based identifiers. Consequently, the upcoming releases will be labeled as iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, etc., streamlining the versioning across platforms.\n \niOS 26 is anticipated to feature a glossy, glass-like interface inspired by visionOS, incorporating translucent elements and rounded buttons. This design language is expected to extend across iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, promoting a cohesive user experience across devices. Core applications like Phone, Safari, and Camera are slated for significant redesigns, too. For instance, Safari may introduce a translucent, \"glassy\" address bar, aligning with the new visual aesthetics.\n \nWhile AI is not expected to be the main focus due to Siri's current readiness, some AI-related updates are rumored. The Shortcuts app may gain \"Apple Intelligence,\" enabling users to create shortcuts using natural language. It's also possible that Gemini will be offered as an option for AI functionalities on the iPhone, similar to ChatGPT.\n \n**Other App and Feature Updates** \nThe lock screen might display charging estimates, indicating how long it will take for the phone to fully charge. There's a rumor about bringing live translation features to AirPods. The Messages app could receive automatic translations and call support; the Music app might introduce full-screen animated lock screen art; and Apple Notes may get markdown support. Users may also only need to log into a captive Wi-Fi portal once, and all their devices will automatically be logged in.\n \nSignificant updates are expected for Apple Home. There's speculation about the potential announcement of a \"HomePad\" with a screen, Apple's competitor to devices like the Nest Hub Mini. A new dedicated Apple gaming app is also anticipated to replace Game Center.\n_\nIf you're expecting new hardware, don't hold your breath. The event is expected to focus primarily on software developments. It may even see discontinued support for several older Intel-based Macs in macOS 26, including models like the 2018 MacBook Pro and the 2019 iMac, as Apple continues its transition towards exclusive support for Apple Silicon devices.\n \nSources:\n[Apple WWDC 2025 Rumors and Predictions!](https://www.youtube.com/@WaveformClips) (Waveform)\n[WWDC 2025 Overview](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/) (MacRumors)\n[WWDC 2025: What to expect from this year's conference](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/wwdc-2025-what-to-expect-from-this-years-conference/) (TechCrunch)\n[What to expect from Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next week](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/what-to-expect-from-apples-worldwide-developers-conference-next-week/) (Ars Technica)\n[Apple's WWDC 2025: How to Watch and What to Expect](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-wwdc-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/) (Wired)\n\n177947816\nstory\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \t\n\t\t\t\tAn anonymous reader quotes a report from OregonLive: _Together, the four founders of Beaverton startup [AheadComputing](https://www.aheadcomputing.com/) spent nearly a century at Intel.
