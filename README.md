# Gnosis Wraith

## Vision: The Adaptive Web Perception Engine

Gnosis Wraith is a powerful web crawling and content analysis system that serves as the perception layer for AI systems. It captures, analyzes, and transforms content through multiple intelligence layers - from basic crawling and OCR to sophisticated AI analysis and integration.

## Quick Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull kordless/gnosis-wraith:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 5678:5678 --name gnosis-wraith kordless/gnosis-wraith:latest

# Access the web interface at http://localhost:5678
```

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  gnosis-wraith:
    image: kordless/gnosis-wraith:latest
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Cloud Deployment

Gnosis Wraith is deployable to Google Cloud Run out of the box, providing a serverless container execution environment:

```bash
# Deploy to Google Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy gnosis-wraith --image kordless/gnosis-wraith:latest --platform managed
```

### Distributed Setup

For high-volume crawling requirements:
- Deploy multiple instances as on-demand crawlers in a distributed setup
- Scale horizontally to increase performance for large crawling operations
- Task system efficiently handles processing delays, making it suitable for asynchronous operation

### Performance Considerations

- While GPU acceleration is supported for OCR and AI processing tasks, the system's asynchronous task architecture efficiently handles processing delays even on CPU-only deployments
- The job system effectively manages resource-intensive operations by queuing and processing them as resources become available

## Browser Extension

For full functionality, install the browser extension:

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5678`
2. Navigate to the "Browser Extension" tab
3. Download and install the extension following browser-specific instructions
4. Use keyboard shortcuts or context menus to capture and analyze web content

## Usage Guide

### Web Interface

The web interface offers multiple ways to interact with Gnosis Wraith:

- **Single URL Crawl** - Process any website with customizable options
- **Image Upload** - Extract text from images using OCR
- **Browser Extension** - Capture and process web content directly

### API Endpoints

- **`/api/crawl`** - Crawl URLs and generate comprehensive reports
- **`/api/upload`** - Upload and analyze images
- **`/api/jobs`** - Manage background processing jobs
- **`/reports`** - Access generated reports

## Storage System

Gnosis Wraith features an advanced storage abstraction layer that supports both local development and cloud deployment:

### Key Features

- **User Isolation**: Each user's reports are stored in separate buckets using SHA-256 hashing
- **Cloud Support**: Automatic switching between local filesystem and Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Built-in support for multiple users with complete data isolation
- **Migration Tools**: Scripts to migrate existing reports to the new structure

### Storage Structure

```
users/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a1b2c3d4e5f6/     # User hash bucket
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/      # User's reports
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/  # User's screenshots
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system/           # System/shared reports
```

## Future Roadmap

Gnosis Wraith is evolving toward a dynamic module system that will:

- üîÑ **Generate Client Modules** - Create Python code to interact with any API or service on demand
- üîÑ **Interface Mirroring** - Simulate any API it observes for other systems to use
- üîÑ **Data Source Integration** - Connect to databases, queues, and network protocols automatically
- üîÑ **Self-Improvement** - Learn from usage patterns to enhance generated code

This system will enable Gnosis Wraith to act as a universal adapter between diverse web services and data sources, dynamically extending its capabilities without manual coding.
